# hello

I'm Allison, a senior at USC, product-obsessed generalist, and lover of lists. Currently studying an integrated degree in CS, design, and business at the [Iovine and Young Academy](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/), reading *[something]*, and trying to figure out the rest.

Welcome to my little internet space â€” it's currently a work in progress. Some other places where I exist on the internet: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisoncyhuang/), [Github](https://github.com/acyhuang), [Are.na](https://www.are.na/allison-huang-5ow-m0wjvfu/channels)

Open problems I'm interested in:

- Interface for observing, steering, and interacting with generative AI ([WIP](https://github.com/acyhuang/steering-interface))
