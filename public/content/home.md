# hello

I'm Allison, a senior at USC, product-obsessed generalist, and lover of lists. Currently studying an integrated degree in CS, design, and business at the [Iovine and Young Academy](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/), reading *[something]*, and trying to figure out the rest.

Welcome to my little internet space â€” it's currently a work in progress. Some other places where I exist online: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisoncyhuang/), [Github](https://github.com/acyhuang), [Are.na](https://www.are.na/allison-huang-5ow-m0wjvfu/channels)

## problems I'm interested in (all loosely related)
- Designing intuitive interfaces for observing and steering large language models ([WIP](https://github.com/acyhuang/steering-interface))
- Ensuring large language models amplify human thinking instead of undermining it (see [Maggie Appleton's characterization](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment))
- Scaling access to personalized education
