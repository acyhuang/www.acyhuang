I'm no more than a hobbyist when it comes to physical fabrication, but I wanted to highlight this project because it captures how I approach projects in spaces I'm particularly unfamliar with.

### Building without a map means preparing for unknown unknowns.

How I've learned to navigate this:
1. Planning to the edge of certainty
2. Buliding a minimum viable product or maximum virtual product early
3. Testing incrementally 

### Making a stool.

As a final project for a materials class, I built a stool using a couple wood joinery techniques. 

![sketches](/projects/stool/sketches.jpg)
Did some quick sketches to solidify the vision.

![cad](/projects/stool/cad.png)
Jumped to CAD to plan more precisely (maximum virtual product), e.g. determining the angle of the legs, calculating how much material I need.

A cardboard prototype helped me get a feel for final dimensions and understand the forms of each piece (minimum viable product). 

![wood joinery](/projects/stool/wood-joinery.jpg)
The joinery was the primary source of uncertainty (How hard is it going to be? Is it likely I'll mess up and need more material?) so made one of each type of joint as a test run.

Only then did I work on the final pieces.

Assembly and staining!
