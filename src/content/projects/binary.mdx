Binary is singleplayer iOS game for converting numbers from base-10 to binary.

Taking inspiration from games like Tetris, NYT Crossword, and Candy Crush, we designed it as an easy way to fill time while building intuition for a (sometimes) valuable skill. We designed both practice and endless runner modes to make the game accessible to new learners and more challenging for those familiar with binary. The game was tested with a couple users from each of these groups to further refine our onboarding and game mechanics. 

As someone who doesn't regularly work on games, this was a fun opportunity to practice designing for retention and learn Unity.

The game was developed in Unity. I was responsible for the concept, design, and about half of the development. While we're no longer working on it, it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/acyhuang/binary) and [Itch.io](https://acyhuang.itch.io/binary).
