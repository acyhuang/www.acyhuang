AI agents can execute multi-step workflows to complete complex tasks. However, these workflows may have conditional or parallel steps, and a human may want to be in the loop at diffrent points to verify agent outputs before continuing to the next step. 

How do we communicate agent orchestration to users, and how do we allow them to specify all of these parameters?
