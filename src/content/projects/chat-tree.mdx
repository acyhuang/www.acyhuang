### Context is key.

To get the best possible results from LLMs, they should have access to relevant context. 

However, conversations aren't always linear. Sometimes, I have several unrelated follow up questions after a single LLM output, and asking them sequentially dilutes the context.

### What if we represented conversations as trees?

Each exchange (a user query and it's corresponding assistant response) is represented as a node. 

This enables:
- **Branching:** Each node can have multiple children. This can be used for quick side questions, or entirely new conversations. 
- **Merging:** (Not yet implemented) Divergent branches could be combined back together to include both branches in context. 
- **Versioning:** Each path from the root node to a leaf node is a separate version of the conversation. The tree becomes a navigation tool for switching between paths.

See a demo:
