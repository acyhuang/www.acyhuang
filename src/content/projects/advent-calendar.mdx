I helped design and develop a digital advent calendar builder. Users can upload all types of media, write notes, or paste links that turn into daily gifts for their loved ones. We had 60 calendars made by 51 users over the month of December. See more here: [https://advent.endofday.studio](https://advent.endofday.studio)

I worked in a team of four to design, develop, and market the product. My specific contributions included:
- building an initial prototype to illustrate the concept
- implementing two iterations of the landing page
- contributing to the production codebase for: sign up/login pages, user dashboard, themes
